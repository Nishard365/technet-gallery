# Microsoft Azure IaaS â€“ Virtual Network Configuration Scripts

This PowerShell script bundle includes three scripts for working with the Azure Virtual Network, Virtual Subnet and IP address assignment.

- `Get-AzureVMStaticIPOverview.ps1` for an overview about IP address information in your Azure Virtual Network.
- `Set-AzureVMSubnet.ps1` for changing the Virtual Subnet of an Azure Virtual Machine.
- `Set-AzureVMStaticIP.ps1` for assigning a static IP address to an Azure Virtual Machine.

For further information in German about this script have a look at my blog (Bing Translator Widget is available at the sidebar):
